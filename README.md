=============

Aurora's auto self-update feature often doesn't work for me, it's just stuck at downloading, this script looks up the current version and compares it against the newest one and updates if needed.

Usage is simple - there are no options! Just don't do anything when a finder window opens.

I am not sure if mozilla does "semiupdates", but sometimes Aurora suggests me updates that have the same version number as i have installed.
